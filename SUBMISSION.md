## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure

Describe your component hierarchy:

**Your structure:**
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Home/Landing page with dark mode toggle)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx (Root layout with FOUC prevention)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule/page.tsx (Main schedule page)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css (Tailwind + dark mode styles)

components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScheduleView.tsx (Main orchestrator component)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DoctorSelector.tsx (Doctor dropdown with async loading)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DayView.tsx (Timeline view with 30-min slots)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WeekView.tsx (Grid view with 60-min slots)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppointmentCard.tsx (Reusable appointment display)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SearchAndFilter.tsx (Search + filter controls)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimeSlot.tsx (Individual time slot row)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Spinner.tsx (Loading states)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DarkModeToggle.tsx (Theme switcher)

hooks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useAppointments.ts (Data fetching & doctor management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useAppointmentSearch.ts (Search & filter logic)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useDarkMode.ts (Theme persistence & system detection)

services/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ appointmentService.ts (Data access layer)

domain/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Appointment.ts (Business logic & utilities)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TimeSlot.ts (Time slot generation & validation)
```

**Why did you structure it this way?**

I followed to the principles of separation of concerns and composition over inheritance: 
1. The presentation (the components), business logic (the domain), data access (the services), and state management (the hooks) are all separated from each other,
2. Created custom hooks which pull stateful logic out of the components so the components can only be presentational and easy to test, 
3. I composed together small components that focused only on that component rather than large monolith components,
4. All the business logic is in domain objects not React components, 
5. Each component/hook/service only has one responsibility (one thing).

---

### State Management

**What state management approach did you use?**
- [X] useState + useEffect only
- [X] Custom hooks (headless pattern)
- [ ] React Context
- [ ] External library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- [ ] Other: _________________

**Why did you choose this approach?**

I decided on custom hooks with the headless pattern because of the following reasons: 

1. The logic is separated from the presentation layer, meaning the components are pure and only render content
2. Hooks can be reusable across different parts of the application
3. The business logic can be tested independently of UI
4. React's built-in optimizations integrate well with hooks
5. No additional external dependencies are needed for this use case
6. Good for a TypeScript use case.

---

### Service Layer

**How did you structure your data access?**

I implemented a class-based service layer (AppointmentService) that:

- Encapsulates all data access logic
- Provides a clean API for the application layer
- Handles data transformation and validation
- Simulates real API behavior with mock data
- Could easily be swapped for real API calls

**What methods did you implement in AppointmentService?**

- [X] getAppointmentsByDoctor(doctorId, date) - Single day appointments
- [X] getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDateRange(doctorId, startDate, endDate) - Week view data
- [X] getPopulatedAppointment(appointment) - Hydrate with patient data
- [X] getAllDoctors() - Doctor list for selector
- [X] validateDateRange(startDate, endDate) - Input validation
- [X] Error simulation and handling

---

### Custom Hooks

**What custom hooks did you create?**

1. useAppointments - Gets appointment details, manages the selected doctor, and loading states. Supports day and week views and manages caching appropriately.

2. useAppointmentSearch- Contributes searching and filtering logic with debouncing. Provides filtered results and managing filters.

3. useDarkMode- Manages persistence of theme and detects system preference

**How do they demonstrate the headless pattern?**

- Clean Logic: Hooks have no UI code - only state and side effects
- Return Values: Hooks return data and functions, not JSX
- Reusability : Same hooks could power different UI implementation
- Testable: Logic can be tested independent of a UI component rendering
- Composition: Hooks can be combined in different ways

## üé® UI/UX Decisions

### Calendar Rendering

**How did you generate time slots?**

I created a domain-driven time slot generator in `domain/TimeSlot.ts`:
- Generates slots based on configurable start/end hours and duration
- Handles timezone considerations
- Validates slot boundaries
- Supports different granularities (30min for day view, 60min for week view)

**How did you position appointments in time slots?**

- Day View: Filters appointments that overlap with each 30-minute slot
- Week View: Uses CSS Grid with calculated positions based on start times
- Overlap Handling: Appointments stack vertically when they overlap
- Responsive : Positions adapt to screen size with proper spacing


**How did you handle overlapping appointments?**

1. Detection : Check if appointment start/end times intersect with slot boundaries
2. Stacking : Multiple appointments in same slot stack with `space-y-1`
3. Visual Separation : Different border colors and background colors
4. Truncation : Long content truncates with ellipsis to prevent overflow

---

### Responsive Design

**Is your calendar mobile-friendly?**
- [X] Yes, fully responsive
- [ ] Partially (some responsive elements)
- [ ] No (desktop only)

**What responsive strategies did you use?**

1. Mobile-First Design : Built for mobile, enhanced for desktop
2. Horizontal Scroll : Week view scrolls horizontally on mobile with scroll hints
3. Flexible Layout : Flexbox and CSS Grid for adaptive layouts
4. Responsive Typography : Text scales appropriately across screen sizes
5. Touch-Friendly : Adequate touch targets and spacing
6. Progressive Enhancement : Features gracefully degrade on smaller screens

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### Code Quality

**Did you run these checks?**
- [X] `npm run lint` - No errors
- [X] `npm run type-check` - No TypeScript errors
- [X] `npm run build` - Builds successfully
- [X] Manual testing - All features work

### Testing Approach

**Did you write any tests?**
- [ ] Yes (describe below)
- [X] No (ran out of time)

## ü§î Assumptions Made

List any assumptions you made while implementing:

1. Business Hours: Assumed standard business hours (8 AM - 6 PM) for calendar display
2. Time Zones: Assumed all times are in the same timezone (no timezone conversion needed)
3. Appointment Duration: Assumed appointments can vary in length and may overlap
4. Data Persistence: Assumed data doesn't need to persist between sessions (mock data only)
5. User Roles: Assumed single user role (no permission-based features needed)
6. Real-time Updates: Assumed no real-time collaboration features needed
7. Appointment Editing: Assumed read-only view (no CRUD operations required)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Limitations

Be honest about any bugs or incomplete features:

1. Week View Appointment Rendering: Long appointment text may truncate more aggressively on very small screens
2. Time Zone Support: No timezone conversion - assumes all users in same timezone
3. Performance: No virtualization for large datasets (fine for current mock data size)
4. Accessibility: Could improve keyboard navigation for appointment cards

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements

What would you add/improve given more time?

1. Virtual Scrolling: Implement virtualization for better performance with hundreds of appointments
2. Drag & Drop: Add appointment rescheduling with drag-and-drop interface
3. Real-time Updates: WebSocket integration for live appointment updates
4. Advanced Filtering: Filter by date ranges, appointment status, patient demographics
5. Export Features: PDF export, calendar sync (Google Calendar, Outlook)
6. Offline Support: Service worker for offline functionality
7. Animation: Smooth transitions between views and states
8. Internationalization: Multi-language support with date/time localization
9. Advanced Search: Fuzzy search, search suggestions, recent searches
10. Performance Monitoring: Add analytics and performance tracking
